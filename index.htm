      With New Horizons coming out soon, I've finally finished documtened the total 26 e-Reader cards that contain town tunes.  
      <br>
      The ones in the first section <img src="images/logos/Doubutsu_no_Mori_+.png">&nbsp;<img src="images/logos/Animal_Crossing.png">, were e-Cards that were released in English & Japanese.

      The ones in the second section <img src="images/logos/Doubutsu_no_Mori_e+.png">, were e-Cards that were only released in Japanese.

      So, what I did was take screenshots of the town tune e-reader screens in both Japanese & English and made a translation chart.

      <br><br>
      With the card-e+ town tunes, I matched the hex # color of the english note with the original Japanese note to make sure it was the correct one.  
      I then recreated it on the <a href="https://tunes.nooknet.net">Island Tune website</a> to make sure it matched up.  I link those on each page that needs it with this icon <img src="images/favicon-32x32.png">.
      I also include the original screenshot just to be sure. If there were any mistakes, please let me know.
